1,"I purchased the OmniStream 4K Pro hub last month hoping it would solve my connectivity problems, but it has been a nightmare of technical glitches from day one. 
Initially, the installation process was smooth, but as soon as I tried to bridge it with my existing mesh network, the device started power cycling randomly. 
I checked the event logs, and it keeps throwing a 'Error 505: Gateway Timeout' every time I attempt a firmware update. 
I’ve tried resetting it to factory settings three times, changing the DNS configuration, and even swapping out the CAT6 cables, but the packet loss is still sitting at around 15% during peak hours. To make matters worse, the companion app crashes on Android 14 whenever I try to access the advanced settings to toggle the firewall. This isn't just a user error; there is clearly a bug in the latest patch that conflicts with legacy router protocols. I need a developer to look at my logs or I need a full refund because this hardware is currently serving as an expensive paperweight.
